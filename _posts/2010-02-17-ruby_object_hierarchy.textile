(Click for a pdf of this. Filled triangles are _class_ relationships, empty
triangles are _super_ relationships, funky diamonds are funky _metaclass_ relationships, thanks _why!)

"Here":/samples/2010-02-17/ruby_object_hierarchy.zip is the source code for this. A few notes on the code:

The code also graphs the '*actual class*' as reported
"here":http://banisterfiend.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/the-secret-life-of-singletons/.
I didn't see the use of that, so it's gone from the version displayed here.

This is probably the most *shoddy piece* of code I've ever released. Note to
self: Breathe out, relax. It doesn't actually hurt.

If you want to run this yourself, call it like this: 

<pre class="sh_bash"><code>
  $ ruby extconf.rb && make
  (... snippage ...)
  $ ruby graph.rb RECURSION_DEPTH > mygraph.dot
</code></pre>

The code does depth first graph traversal over Ruby's object graph and outputs
a "graphviz":http://www.graphviz.org/ dot file. It seems that while recursion depths bigger than
3 are sure funky, they don't add much to the picture. 

A few things that are interesting in the above graph (trying not to be
redundant with others):

* There are really a lot more metaclasses than you think. They might gather in
  groups and descend upon you in your sleep, even. You think turtles is bad?
  Metaclasses is way badder.
* Class really ties the room together. Without it, Ruby would really be off
  balance. I guess that's why its called _class oriented programming_.
* Everything is created out of nothing. It fits with my belief system to have
  <code>nil</code> sit on the top of that diagram. 

Happy hacking!
