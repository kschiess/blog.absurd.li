"Parslet":http://kschiess.github.com/parslet is a small parser framework for
Ruby. It uses the PEG formalism for its grammars, and its not alone to do so. 
I have been asked to compare parslet to Treetop XXX and Citrus XXX. For 
raw parsing speed. With complicated grammars. 

I've generated treetop and citrus versions from "rkhs":rkh "Ansi Smalltalk
grammar":Reak. As a byproduct, parslet now exposes visitors for the grammar
and can generate these two formats as string.

Benchmarks have been run using the above grammar with varying input sizes. 
This matters a lot for this grammar, since it nests very deep. Speed is not
going to vary linearly with size of input in some cases. 

I've included two versions of parslet, the current one and the very soon to
be released (these days in fact) 1.1.0. The difference between the two is
about one month of performance optimization. 

Treetop and citrus enter the competition with the latest released gems. I 
am putting the code that generates these grammars into the next release of 
parslet, so these benchmarks can be rerun once either one changes. 

Here are the pure numbers: 

| *Input size* | *parslet-1.0* | *parslet-1.1* | *treetop* | *citrus* |
| 1          | 2           | 3           | 4       | 5      |
