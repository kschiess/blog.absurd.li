I am going to explain OpenID in just the time it takes to cook a chicken soup.
Those two hours will allow me to write just the really simple explanation I
have been looking for on the internets recently. My throwing in some Ruby code
and some diagrams will allow you to hopefully create an OpenID consumer with
some trust in what you are doing and in less time than it took me.

h2. OpenID? What is that?

OpenID will allow you to use multiple sites with just one login. Follow this
"link":http://openid.net/ to get to know more on the topic. I am going to
assume you 
  
  # know what OpenID is (from a users perspective) and 
  # you already have one.

h2. How does it work?

Keep in mind that we're running against the clock here and bear with me while
I insult your user with the following diagram: 

!/img/2009-11-29/openid_sequence.png!:http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/2009/03/visualization-a-la-dilbert/

Authenticating your user in 4 easy steps: 

1. Your user gives you an OpenID, claiming it's his.

2. You perform discovery on the OpenID. You find out that in reality, 'the OpenID provider' will answer questions about 'the users OpenID'.

3. So you redirect your user to his OpenID provider. You pass along data that
will help ask the question: "Is this guy who he says he is?"

4. You don't care about how your user identifies to his service. All you care
about is that you get your user redirected back to you and that this special 
redirect carries data proving the users association with the OpenID he gave.

h1. And in Practice

You should install "ruby-openid":http://openidenabled.com/ruby-openid/ (<code>gem install ruby-openid</code>). Imaging that you have a form that
POSTs the users OpenID as '<code>:openid</code>'. Steps 2 & 3 above would 
look like this: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  def start
    # Did the user fill in the field? (maybe step 1 failed)
    render 'form' and return unless params[:openid]
  
    # Perform discovery (step 2)
    openid_request = openid.begin(params[:openid])
    
    return_to = url_for :action => :complete, :only_path => false
    realm     = root_url

    # Send the user to his provider (step 3)
    redirect_to openid_request.redirect_url(realm, return_to)
    
  rescue OpenID::OpenIDError
    # Step 2 (Discovery) failed
    render 'form'
  end
</code></pre>
 
Please keep in mind that this is a really stripped down no-nonsense version
of the code that only serves to illustrate the concept simply. I'll point
you to correct (and more complex) code later. 

As you can see we redirect the user to an URL that comes straight out of the 
discovery process. We pass along a realm and a <code>return_to</code>-url, so
that when the user has finished talking to his provider, he will come back and
call our <code>#complete</code> action.

I am obviously skipping over a lot of detail, including but not limiting
myself to where you get the <code>'openid'</code> instance from. Now there's
something uninteresting I don't want to talk about! As I said, all the useful
stuff will be in the end- and footnotes, as usual[1]. 

Back to our main narrative: The user finishes authenticating with his OpenID
provider and comes back to <code>return_to</code> – meaning our
<code>#complete</code> action:

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  def complete
    this_url          = url_for :action => 'complete', :only_path => false
    this_urls_params  = request.query_parameters
    
    # Verify the OpenID security answer with what we think it should be (step 4)
    openid_response = openid.complete(this_urls_params, this_url)
    
    if openid_response.status == OpenID::Consumer::SUCCESS
      # All right: The guy is who he says he is.
    else
      # Nope.
    end
  end
</code></pre>

We pass the <code>#complete</code> method the url we're supposed to be at and
the query parameters the way Rails sees them before mixing in
'<code>:action</code>' and '<code>:controller</code>'. This will call back to
the OpenID provider once more to check if everything is as it should be.

Once verification of query parameters, of cryptographic hashes and subliminal
messages succeeds - we can let the user in. Note that verifying an OpenID is
like verifying an email address. We don't know anything about the users
identity yet, only about his association to the OpenID. It turns out that this
is often enough. This is standard practice with email after all.

h2. More information

can be found in the sample Rails application provided in the
<code>examples</code> subdirectory of the <code>ruby-openid</code> gem. Have a
look at the
"Consumers":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ruby-openid/blob/master/examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/consumer_controller.rb
Controller. Some of that code really is more complex than it needs to be –
keep in mind that it just handles a lot of cases in the same bit of code. Most
applications wont need to copy that complexity.

The code of <code>ruby-openid</code> is also "well
annotated":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ruby-openid/tree/master/lib/. It
reads a bit like the Python it is ported from, but apart from that is really
ok. Go have a look!

h2. In parting

a few last words: I hope to have simplified OpenID and the use of
'ruby-openid'. I would be interested to hear your comments and thoughts -
leave them below. Also. And most importantly. If you have any really good
*recipe for chicken soup*, I'd be most happy to borrow it from you.

[1] The <code>#openid</code> method should be implemented about the same way
the <code>#consumer</code> method in the rails example of <code>ruby-openid</code>
is.
