For those of you following the thrift_over_amqp_transport plugin: I have just
finished a complete rewrite. The 'plugin' is now called 'toamqp' and is
available through rubygems: 

<pre class="sh_sh"><code>
  $ gem install toamqp
</code></pre>

The version that is currently published has some minor bugs. I will publish
another version real soon now (0.3.1) that fixes those and then some. 

h2. The redesign

Starting with the new version it is now really easy to create server and client
for a AMQP service. Really, its just a few lines: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # A real small server: 
  class MyServiceImplementation < TOAMQP::Service::Base
    serves ThriftServiceModule
    exchange :my_service
    
    # Service methods go here
  end
  
  TOAMQP.server(MyServiceImplementation.new).serve
</code></pre>

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # A real small (smaller!) client
  client = TOAMQP.client(:my_service, ThriftServiceModule)
</code></pre>

Please have a look at the README in the
"source":http://github.com/kschiess/toamqp. I've also included a few samples
in the '<code>examples</code>' subdirectory of the project â€“ this should get
you running in no time.

I will publish a real HOWTO for a few sample use cases here soon.
