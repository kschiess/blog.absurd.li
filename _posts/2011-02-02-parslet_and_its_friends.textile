"Parslet":http://kschiess.github.com/parslet is a small parser framework for
Ruby. It uses the PEG formalism for its grammars, and its not alone to do so.
I have been asked to compare parslet to
"Treetop":http://github.com/nathansobo/treetop and
"Citrus":http://github.com/mjijackson/citrus. For raw parsing speed. With
complicated grammars.

I've generated treetop and citrus versions from "rkhs":https://github.com/rkh
"Ansi Smalltalk grammar":https://github.com/rkh/Reak. As a byproduct, parslet
now exposes visitors for the grammar and can generate these two formats as
string.

Benchmarks have been run using the above grammar with varying input sizes. 
This matters a lot for this grammar, since it nests very deep. Speed is not
going to vary linearly with size of input in some cases. 

I've included two versions of parslet, the current one and the very soon to
be released (these days in fact) 1.1.0. The difference between the two is
about one month of performance optimization. 

Treetop and citrus enter the competition with the latest released gems. (1.4.9
and 2.3.4 respectively) I am putting the code that generates these grammars
into the next release of parslet, so these benchmarks can be rerun once either
one changes.

Here are the pure numbers: 

| *Input size* | *parslet-1.0* | *parslet-1.1* | *treetop* | *citrus* |
| 185 chars    | 23.644s       | 0.291s        | 0.644s    | 2.503s   |
| 361 chars    | 14m28.970s    | 0.335s        | 0.405s    | 1m16.155s|
| 671 chars    | 19m2.713s     | 0.390s        | 0.421s    | 1m26.287s|
| 1671 chars   | _ages_        | 0.581s        | 0.477s    | 1m34.930s|
| 9796 chars   | _ages_        | 2.281s        | 0.933s    | 5m8.059s |
| 22186 chars  | _ages_        | 5.521s        | 1.630s    | 7m35.694s|

These figures have been measured on my weakly MacBook Air (1.6 GHz, the old
one) using Ruby 1.9.2 p136. The exact figures don't matter much, we're after a
graphic of big O here:

As you can see, treetop and parslet kind of fight it out along the X axis. 
Here's another graphic that displays the relevant details of that:

h1. Conclusions

There is a big difference between the 1.0 and 1.1 version of parslet. In 
fact, I think it is now big enough to warrant a release. I'll continue to do
performance optimization. The numbers indicate that parslet looses out 
versus treetop for big inputs because it allocates a lot of small objects. 
I might find ways around that. 

One of the ideas I'm tossing around is to optimize not only the way work is 
being done, but the amount of work itself. If you imagine a tiny part
of a grammar that is still not too unlikely to occur in reality: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  str('chunky') >> str('bacon')
</code></pre>

It is quite obvious that this could be simplified by a grammar walk to

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  str('chunkybacon')
</code></pre>

This impacts on several levels. There is now just one parslet to test against,
which means less code to execute. Input is read in bigger chunks; this will
also benefit performance. And finally, error messages might even be improved
by an optimized version of the grammar. Did I mention that you can now visit
the grammar tree inside parslet by requiring
<code>parslet/atoms/visitor</code>? So things are ready for this step, its
just that I want to flush the other changes to the public, so to speak, before
starting something new.

h2. Parslet vs...

Comparing parslet against treetop or citrus based on performance alone will
always miss the point. Certainly parsing speed matters. But being able to
progress with your parser project and not hit roadblocks early matters just as
much. I've gotten good feedback in that respect; it seems that what works for
me also worked for others. Also, I am happy that people on irc
(<code>#parslet</code> on freenode) have been helping each other out,
(re)creating the friendly atmosphere I associate with Ruby.

I think parslet needs to make further progress in several directions. One
direction will certainly be execution speed. And treetops code generation
really does a lot, at least so it seems. But realize, treetop does less work
as well; parslet keeps all these detailed error messages around for you to
peruse. That's got to count, right?

h2. These are exciting times

And I am happy to be part of it. If you haven't seen parslets quiet beauty 
yet, you should head to the "project home page":http://kschiess.github.com/parslet and check it out. If you have, please
upgrade to 1.1 – it contains bug fixes and a speedy core. Doing so
will improve both yours and your users experience!
