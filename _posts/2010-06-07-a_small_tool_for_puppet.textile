To complement last weeks post about "getting puppet into your
datacenter":/2010/05/27/how_to_get_your_very_own_puppet_show.html, here's a
small post on a tool I wrote to monitor your puppets.

The tool will look at <code>/var/log/messages</code> and look for the last 
successful puppet run for all your nodes (as given by 

<pre class="sh_bash"><code>
  $ puppetca -al
</code></pre>

). It needs to be run as root. 

You can download it "from github":http://github.com/kschiess/last_puppetrun.

<pre class="sh_bash"><code>
  git clone git://github.com/kschiess/last_puppetrun.git
</code></pre>

h2. Not the same as <code>puppetlast</code>

Connaisseurs of puppet will bark: "But there is already puppetlast". _Yes.
There is._ The information <code>puppetlast</code> gives you is _"When did
puppet last run on host X"_?. That is not at all the same as "When did puppet
last _successfully_ run on host X?" - which is the answer provided by
<code>last_puppetrun</code>.

If you have a parse error / a doubly defined resource in your puppet recipes, 
the tool presented here will allow you to see the problem early.
