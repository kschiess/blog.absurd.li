When I mention "puppet":http://www.puppetlabs.com/ to people, a lot of them
answer: "Oh, don't get started on this, I should do that as well." Yeah, well
guess what, you should. Here's my helping hand to that. 

Puppet is a tool that allows you to manage the configuration of your data
center in a recipe and then apply it to each machine. It is open-sourceish and
developed by a company called 'Puppet Labs' (formerly: 'Reductive Labs') in 
Portland, Oregon. 

Here's what you need to get started with puppet: 

* *A puppet master*
  This can be any machine at all, although I would recommend you virtualize
  this. The puppet master will not be doing a lot at first. It seems like a 
  real box would be wasted on this. 
  
* At least *one other machine* you want to manage. 

Of course, the real benefits of puppet will apply when you manage hundreds or 
thousands of machines with it. But. Knowing puppet, I would even manage my two
machine production setup with it. For any kind of setup that has real value, 
you need a description of some kind on how to reconstruct the machines should
you loose them completely. Most people have started entering this step-by-step information into a Wiki of a kind. Puppet can be that as well. 

Either way. Here's what comes next in this article: 

* Install the puppet master
* Create an initial configuration repository
* Install puppet on the clients
