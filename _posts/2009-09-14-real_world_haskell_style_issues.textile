I am reading the book "Real World Haskell"[1] – and enjoying it to my
surprise. What I find really hard to understand is why the authors chose a
code style this opaque. My message to you: 
_Code really is read more than it is written._ Here's an example straight from the book:

<pre class="sh_haskell"><code>
  liftP2 q f g w x y z = f w x y z `q` g w x y z
</code></pre>

That's a *series of 18 lower case letters* in a row, lightened up by a few
cryptic line noise like dots and dashes. My growing fondness of the language
might come to an abrupt end if I wake up to a community that writes this kind
of code...

But to end this post on an upbeat note, I really would like to congratulate
the authors of the book. _Real World Haskell_ really is up there with the
programming language introductions that make you want to pick up the tool and
rewrite an operating system in it. It reads nicely from the start to the end, 
and if you manage to skimp/skip/plow through the examples like the one I 
gave above, you'll find a lot of nice code as well. Worth reading!
