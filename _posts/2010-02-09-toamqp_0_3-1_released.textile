Just a quick note to let you know that I am releasing
"toamqp":http://github.com/kschiess/toamqp today. I've already presented
all the "novelties":/2010/01/26/the_new_thrift_over_amqp_explained.html in 
this place, now its time to get the code some action. 

This release includes many bugfixes and code cleanups. It also features
a <code>TOAMQP::SpecServer</code> helper class that allows easier testing
of the code. With this testing becomes a breeze - you set it up like this: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  server = TOAMQP.server(MyHandler.new, TOAMQP::SpecServer)
</code></pre>

Then you get two options; either you make all the calls and then call

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  server.serve
</code></pre>

This will act on all the messages that wait at the broker and then return. 
When you want to satisfy your mock's expectations, this is the method to use. 

You can also use

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  server.serve_in_thread
</code></pre>

and then go off and make a bunch of client calls. Just don't forget to tear 
down this server thread: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  server.stop_and_join
</code></pre>

This will wait for the thread to close down.
