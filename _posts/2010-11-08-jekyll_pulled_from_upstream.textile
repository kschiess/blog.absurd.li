For those who use my inofficial fork of
"jekyll":http://github.com/kschiess/jekyll that also speaks haml, good news:
I've just completed another merge of the new features of jekyll with the
changes that enable haml and sass.

This time the merge bridges a gap of two minor versions; a lot of changes had
happened upstream. Looks like we might soon be able to close down this fork
and get official haml/sass support in jekyll, albeit only in unsafe mode. 

Anyway, update today.
