TODO Write about specification and code and their relationship. Not writing down the spec, about loosing it.
TODO Write about why coming up with the specification is hard. 
      Specifiactions are experiments and as such HARD - its not a basic method

h3. Specs should be isolated

To be of any use, your specs need only address one thing at a time. Nobody can
provide a useful description of a system by changing the topic in every other
sentence. Mocks and Stubs let you keep this kind of focus: You just pretend
you have all the parts already and specify just the missing piece.

Pretending you have something has the nice property of getting you to figure
out what that is without thinking about it directly. Design is often easier 
if done casually, like in role play during some OOP methodologies. 

Pretending by mocking/stubbing will naturally let you drift towards interfaces
that are easily mocked/stubbed. That often means: 

* Few complex dependencies
* Clear responsibilities
* Few method parameters
* Separating actions from getters



* Reflection on what code to even write is forced early
